## Requirements

Create a simple application that shows the complete specifications of a user’s device(mobile). Make sure
to include the details laid out below. Create a simple user interface but try to make it minimal and use
creative approaches to design it.

Functional Structure.
1. Get the total number of integrated components / hardware’s in the device (e.g. processor,
camera, ram etc)
a. Categorize as components / hardware
2. Get the details of components (e.g. Processor = Snapdragon577 & manufactured 2009 etc).
3. Challenge yourself to find & collect as much data as you can in regards to the installed
components.
4. Users should open app and click button to scan device.
5. After scan, details should be displayed to the user.
6. App should create a simple file after scan and save all the details in that file.
